# Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis-RealTime

## Description of the project
This project aims to stream tweets in real-time using Kafka, perform sentiment analysis on the tweets using Spark, and display the results using a Flask web application. The tweets are collected using the Twitter API and sent to a Kafka topic for processing. Spark is then used to perform sentiment analysis on the tweets, and the results are stored in a database. The Flask application provides a user-friendly interface to view the sentiment analysis results, which are pulled from the database and displayed in real-time. This project demonstrates the ability to build a real-time streaming and processing pipeline for social media data and use it to gain insights on public opinion.
